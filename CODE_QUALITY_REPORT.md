 Code Quality Report
 Initial Linting Summary
Total Issues: 22

Errors: 21

Warnings: 1

 Resolution Summary
The majority of the errors originated from auto-generated files in the dist folder. These files are not part of the source code and were excluded from linting by updating the ESLint configuration to ignore them.

One warning was due to the use of console.error, which is intentional for error logging. This rule was kept as a warning rather than an error to allow for essential debugging logs.

 Final Linting State
